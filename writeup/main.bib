abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The environments in which we live, work, breathe, and play are subject to enormous variability in air pollutant concentrations. To adequately characterize air quality, measurements must be fast (real-time), scalable, and reliable (with known accuracy, precision, and stability over time). Low-cost AQ sensor technologies offer new opportunities for fast and distributed measurements, but a persistent characterization gap remains when it comes to evaluating sensor performance under realistic environmental sampling conditions. This limits our ability to inform stakeholders about pollution sources and inspire policy makers to address environmental justice air quality issues. In this paper, initial results obtained with a recently developed low-cost air quality sensor system are reported. In this project, data were acquired with the ARISense integrated sensor package over a 4-month time interval during which the sensor system was co-located with a state-operated (Massachusetts, USA) air quality monitoring station equipped with reference instrumentation measuring the same pollutant species. This paper focuses on validating electrochemical sensor measurements of CO, NO, NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, and O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. Through the use of High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR), we show that interference effects derived from changing environmental conditions and the ambient-gas concentration mix encountered at an urban neighborhood site can be effectively modelled for the Alphasense CO-B4, NO-B4, NO2-B43F, and Ox-B421 sensors, improving the credibility of air pollutant measurements made with these sensors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Low cost gas multisensor devices can represent an efficient solution for densifying the sparse urban air pollution monitoring mesh. In a previous work, we proposed and evaluated the calibration of such a device using short term on-field recorded data for the benzene pollution quantification. In this work, we present and discuss the results obtained for CO, NO2 and total NOx pollutants concentration estimation with the same set up. Conventional air pollution monitoring station is used to provide reference data. We show how a multivariate calibration can be achieved with the use of two weeks long on-field data recording and neural regression systems. Also for these pollutants, no significant performance boost was detectable when longer recordings were used. The influence of an appropriate feature selection for achieving optimal performances is also discussed comparing long term performance results of the obtained calibrations. Benefits and issues of multivariate correlation based calibration are evaluated during one year long measurement campaign. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The air pollution monitoring paradigm is rapidly changing due to recent advances in (1) the development of portable, lower-cost air pollution sensors reporting data in near-real time at a high-time resolution, (2) increased computational and visualization capabilities, and (3) wireless communication/infrastructure. It is possible that these advances can support traditional air quality monitoring by supplementing ambient air monitoring and enhancing compliance monitoring. Sensors are beginning to provide individuals and communities the tools needed to understand their environmental exposures with these data individual and community-based strategies can be developed to reduce pollution exposure as well as understand linkages to health indicators. Each of these areas as well as corresponding challenges (e.g., quality of data) and potential opportunities associated with development and implementation of air pollution sensors are discussed.},

@article{Spinelle2015,
abstract = {Abstract The performances of several field calibration methods for low-cost sensors, including linear/multi linear regression and supervised learning techniques are compared. A cluster of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen monoxide, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide sensors was operated. The sensors were either of metal oxide or electrochemical type or based on miniaturized infra-red cell. For each method, a two-week calibration was carried out at a semi-rural site against reference measurements. Subsequently, the accuracy of the predicted values was evaluated for about five months using a few indicators and techniques: orthogonal regression, target diagram, measurement uncertainty and drifts over time of sensor predictions. The study assessed if the sensors were could reach the Data Quality Objective (DQOs) of the European Air Quality Directive for indicative methods (between 25 and 30{\%} of uncertainty for O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}). In this study it appears that O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} may be calibrated using simple regression techniques while for NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} a better agreement between sensors and reference measurements was reached using supervised learning techniques. The hourly O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} DQO was met while it was unlikely that NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} hourly one could be met. This was likely caused by the low NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} levels correlated with high O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} levels that are typical of semi-rural site where the measurements of this study took place.},
